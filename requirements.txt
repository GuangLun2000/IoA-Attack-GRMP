# Core dependencies for GRMP attack simulation with GPU support
# Version upper bounds: only use releases that existed before 2026-01-30 (no "current latest").
# - PyTorch 2.10.0 was 2026-01-21; 2.11+ would be after cutoff.
# - Transformers 5.0.0 was 2026-01-26; 5.1+ would be after cutoff. 4.35+ needs models._ensure_decoder_config_pad_token() for Pythia.
